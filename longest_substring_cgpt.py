"""
Problem:
You are given a string s and an integer k.
Return the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

ðŸ”¹ Example
Input:  s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: "ece" is the longest substring with at most 2 distinct characters.

Input:  s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: "aa" is the longest substring with at most 1 distinct character.
